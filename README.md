## Why Gatsby?

The biggest and perhaps most fundamental reason for me choosing Gatsby was wanting to gain some more experience with React and for a chance to use Graphql.

Set-up and support was great and particularly helpful and entertaining have be the code along sessions on <https://www.learnwithjason.dev/>

Having previously used Jekyll the concept of a static site generator is wasn't new and as both have the option to use Markdown I could also refresh my knowledge in the area.
