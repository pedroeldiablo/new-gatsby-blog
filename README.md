# Blog Built with Gatsby

## [peter-ldn-gatsby-blog](https://peter-ldn-gatsby-blog.netlify.app/)

A simple dev focused blog site used both as practice and a reminder.

Broadly speaking this progressed out of wanting more hands on experience in working with React, however the focus and outcomes have drifted on many ocassions.

The earlier posts are predominantly breakdowns of MarkDown for no other reason than that the posts themselves were being written in MD. Rather than having to search Google for reminders of how to add links in different styles it was possible to refer to the [Markdown Links](https://peter-ldn-gatsby-blog.netlify.app/markdown-links/) page.

Following this there is a lean into React hooks. These pages will be revised and amended further as they skim the surface and are currently barely more than a rephrasing of the React documentation.

Some notes on data structures follow, interspersed with random pages which were used almost in a journal fashion to record ideas or prototypes that didn't really belong anywhere else.

## Where next?

There are plenty of areas even within the development of this site that still haven't been mentioned.
Some topics that will hopefully be covered to a greater of lesser extent are ([Markdown Lists](https://peter-ldn-gatsby-blog.netlify.app/markdown-lists/)):

1. Deploying to Netlify and building
2. Graphql
3. Gatsby pluggins
4. Mailchimp integrations
5. Github actions
6. Styled-components/CSS in JS

Functionality that might be needed as the number of posts grows includes filters and search. Currently the titles are working over time to make the posts somewhat navigable, however a more robust solution would be helpful.
