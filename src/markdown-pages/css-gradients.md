### Gradients

Creating a gradient with two axis. Currently there isn't an option to define a gradient in this way as a single property. Instead it requires the combination of two linear-gradients that are defined at right angles to one another. 


```css
body {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, cyan);
  min-height: 100vh;
  
  &:before {
		content: "";
		position: absolute;
		top: 0;
		left: 0;
		bottom: 0;
        right: 0;
		mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent, black);
		background: linear-gradient(90deg, hotpink, rebeccapurple);	
  }
}
```
