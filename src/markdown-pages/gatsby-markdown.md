### Getting to Grips with Gatsby.

Will there ever be a day when I'm using Markdown sufficiently to remember the syntax without needing to look it up? 

[Rewording the ever helpful cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)

Headers - add a hash for each h

# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

Alternatively, for 

H1 follow the line of text with a triple set of equals signs
===

H2 follow the line of text with a triple set of minus signs
---

Emphasis aka italics at a * to either *end of the word/phrase* without a gap between the first character or last and the *. Alternatively replace * with _ underscores.  

Strong/Bold add two * or _ instead of one. 

Need strong italics? Combine ** and _ or __ and * as you would wrapping quotes. 

Strikethrough by adding double tilde at the start and end. 

Everything together

~~*Strike through italics and __bold italics__*~~
