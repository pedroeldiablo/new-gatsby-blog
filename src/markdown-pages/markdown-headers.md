### Markdown Mastery

Will there ever be a day when I'm using Markdown sufficiently to remember the syntax without needing to look it up? Possibly, but until then notes are essential companion.

[Rewording the ever helpful cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)

Headers - add a hash for each h

# H1

## H2

### H3

#### H4

##### H5

###### H6

Alternatively, for

# H1 follow the line of text with a triple set of equals signs

## H2 follow the line of text with a triple set of minus signs

Emphasis aka italics at a *to either*end of the word/phrase*without a gap between the first character or last and the*. Alternatively replace \* with \_ underscores.

Strong/Bold add two \* or \_ instead of one.

Need strong italics? Combine \*_and \_ or \_\_ and_ as you would wrapping quotes.

Strikethrough by adding double tilde at the start and end.

Everything together

~~_Strike through italics and **bold italics**_~~
