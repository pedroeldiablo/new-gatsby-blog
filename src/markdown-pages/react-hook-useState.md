# useState

```
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
```

Breaking this down. Array destructuring. 

useState takes one arguement. This is the initial state. It returns a pair. 

`state` is the current state.
`setState` is a function that allows you to update the state. 

Unlike normal variables which only exist at runtime, the state variables are preserved by React. So state can persist.



#### Example

```
const [age, setAge ] = useState(37);
```

Initial state is 37. 
`age` on initialisation will be 37.
`setAge` is a function that we can define to update `age`. 

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
    <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
