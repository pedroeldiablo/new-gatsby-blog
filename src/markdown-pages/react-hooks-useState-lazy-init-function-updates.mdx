# useState

When you call useState with the initial state value it returns an array with the value of that state and a "state dispatch function" for updating it.

```js
// Using array destructuring useState returns the state (state) and set state dispatch function (setState)
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
```

Calling the state dispatch function triggers a re-render of the component. This causes useState to be called again which retrieves the new state value and dispatch function.

```js
import React, { useState } from "react"

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Setting Inital State with a function

```js
function AgeMe() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(() => 37)
  const increment = () => setAge(previousAge => previousAge + 1)
  return <button onClick={increment}>{age}</button>
}
```

<AgeMe />

Initial state is still 37, however this time it is the result of the return of a fuction that is called.
`age` on initialisation will be 37.
`setAge` dispatch is called with a function that accepts the previous state and returns a new one.

#### Why take this approach?

Every time we click the button we update the state and cause a re-render.
This means that for every click the AgeMe function is called.

The function body runs, and all the code inside it runs.
Any variables you create or arguments you pass are created and evaluated every render.

Big deal? Most of the time no.

When this becomes more of a perfomance issue is when the variables or arguements are themselves computationally intensive or slow.
Remember the initial state is only used on the components first render.

One example for this might be retrieving the value of the initial state from local storage.
There are many cases where this would be useful, such as retrieving a shopping baskets saved on a users device.

We want to do this on the initial render. For subsequent renders we are using the updated state (even if we are also updating the values stored in local storage),
but would still suffer the performance impact if we are initialing and assigning this to a variable.

### How does using a function to set the initial state help?

Creating a function and calling a function are two different things.
While the function will be created everytime we render, it will only be called on the initial render.
We get the benefit of being able to use the value returned by the function on our inital render, but without the negative impact on subsequent renders.
This method is referred to as 'lazy initialisation'

```js
function SnoozeRemaining() {
  const initialSnooze = Number(window.localStorage.getItem("snooze-preference"))
  const [timeRemaining, setTimeRemaining] = useState(initialSnooze)
  const incrementTimeRemaining = extraTime =>
    setTimeRemaining(timeRemaining => timeRemaining + extraTime)
  return (
    <>
      <div>{timeRemaining}</>
      <button onClick={() => incrementTimeRemaining(1)}>Add one minute</button>
      <button onClick={() => incrementTimeRemaining(2)}>Add two minutes</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

```js
function SnoozeRemaining() {
  const initialSnooze = () =>
    Number(window.localStorage.getItem("snooze-preference") | 0)
  const [timeRemaining, setTimeRemaining] = useState(initialSnooze)
  const incrementTimeRemaining = value => {
    setTimeRemaining(previousRemaining => previousRemaining + value)
  }
  const cancelSnooze = () => setTimeRemaining(0)
  return (
    <>
      <div>{timeRemaining}</div>
      <button onClick={() => incrementTimeRemaining(1)}>Add one minute</button>
      <button onClick={() => incrementTimeRemaining(2)}>Add two minutes</button>
      <button onClick={() => cancelSnooze()}>Cancel snooze</button>
    </>
  )
}
```

<SnoozeRemaining />
