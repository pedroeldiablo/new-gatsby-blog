# React Hooks

## Hooks were added in React 16.8. They allow state and other React features to be used without writing a class, aka making it easier to use Functional components

Why is this interesting? Sharing stateful logic between components has been difficult. While there are libraries like Redux and patterns like render props and higher-order components that have provided solutions they are often unsatisfactory or have negative side effects such as "wrapper hell". By separating the stateful logic from the UI and component hierarchy hooks make sharing this logic simpler.

Along with this change is a move to thinking less in the lifecycle methods as associated with classes and more towards an approach based around synchronization.
